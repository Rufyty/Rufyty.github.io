# 🚀 My Journey into Hacking

## 🌱 Curiosity
I’ve always been that person who wanted to know *“why”* behind everything.  
As a kid, I wasn’t satisfied just using technology — I wanted to know **how it worked**.  
This curiosity started with breaking gadgets (sometimes accidentally 😅) and grew into exploring how computers think.

## 💻 Programming
My first step was learning **programming**.  
It felt like unlocking a new language that machines understood.  
I started small — writing scripts, building little projects, debugging errors.  
Each bug was frustrating, but solving it felt like solving a puzzle.  
That moment when code *finally runs*? Addicting.

## 🕶️ Hacking Passion
Soon, I realized that knowing how to build is only half the story.  
The other half? Learning how things **break**.  

That passion led me into **ethical hacking**:  
- Understanding security flaws  
- Exploring how attackers think  
- Practicing Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges  
- Building, breaking, and fixing systems  

What began as curiosity turned into a **lifestyle** — *Hack. Learn. Repeat.*

## 📌 Highlights
- 🌐 Explored web hacking (SQLi, XSS, SSRF, Auth bypass, etc.)  
- 🐧 Got hands-on with Linux & privilege escalation  
- 🔍 Completed OWASP Top 10 labs
-  Practicing PortSwigger labs  
- ✍️ Writing my journey here — sharing knowledge with others
- Mastered PHP, SQL, Python,memchached, JavaScript, Bash

## 🤝 Collaboration
I believe hacking is not just about individual skills but also **teamwork**.  
I’m currently looking to:  
- Join or create **CTF teams**  
- Collaborate on **security research & labs**  
- Share knowledge with fellow hackers  

If you’re interested in teaming up, let’s connect and hack together 💀🔥

## 🛣️ Where I’m Headed
This is just the beginning.  
I want to:  
- Keep sharpening my skills in **Web, System, and Network hacking**  
- Dive deeper into **CTFs, bug bounties, and red teaming**  
- Contribute to the hacker community by sharing writeups, notes, and tools
- Collaborate with other hackers

👉 This blog is my **journal & portfolio**.  
Every article, CTF writeup, or experiment I post here is another step in my journey.  
Stick around — the best is yet to come ✨
